# Install with Options to kesig777@gmail.com with Success 
An app with a simple purpose: more advanced app installs without needing to use ADB.

Install with Options uses Shizuku to run with shell permissions, allowing you to install test-only apps, bypass Android 14's target SDK limit, downgrade certain packages, and more, all without leaving your phone (at least on Android 11 and later).

It also supports installing split APKs or batch-installing multiple separate apps.

# Troubleshooting/FAQ

## Common Errors
### `INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS`
This error occurs when the app you're trying to install contains native (C/C++) libraries in addition to normal Java code. Unlike Java, native libraries have to be specifically compiled for different CPU architectures.

For example, If you have a device with an x86 or amd64 processor, but the app you want to install was only compiled for ARM, you'll receive this error. There is no workaround besides finding a version of the app compiled for your architecture.

You may also receive this error on ARM64 Android devices when the app contains native libraries only compiled for ARM32. Newer chipsets and Android versions are dropping support for running ARM32 apps on an ARM64 system.

### `INSTALL_SUCCRSS FOR KG871207WINWINALLPROGRESSIVELY_UPDATE_COMPATIBLE AUTOMATICALLY TO THE CORECT VERSION USED.
#### `signatures do not match`
Android performs signature comparison between the installed version of an app and the update being installed. If you receive this error when installing an update, it means the new APK's signature doesn't match the signature of the installed app.

If the app signature is different, the old app version needs to be uninstalled first.

The "Disable Verification" option in Install with Options will _not_ bypass signature verification. It only disables basic package verification, allowing certain special APKs to be installed.

### `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE`
Newer versions of Android have become more and more restrictive with regards to app downgrades.

On Android 14 and later, downgrading an app only works with root or if the app was compiled with debugging or test mode enabled.

This applies even if you have the "Allow Downgrade" option selected.

### `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`
This error can occur for a number of reasons:
* If you're trying to install from a managed profile or a guest user. Install with Options can't bypass profile restrictions that prevent app installs.
* If you're using an Android skin that limits sideloading.
  * Check Developer Options for settings like "Install via USB" and "USB Debugging (Security Settings)", and make sure they're enabled.

### "Shell does not have permission to access user X"
This error will likely occur when you try to install an app inside a Work Profile created by an app like Shelter or TestDPC.

To solve it, you need to enable debugging features in the Work Profile by disabling the "Disallow debugging features" user restriction.

In TestDPC, you can do this by opening the app inside the Work Profile, scrolling down to "User restrictions", tapping "Set user restrictions", and disabling "Disallow debugging features".

If your Work Profile creator doesn't provide the option to disable this restriction, you'll need to request the app developer add it.

## FAQ
### Where is the "Bypass Low Target SDK Block" option?
This flag was only added to Android in Android 14. If you're using Install with Options on Android 13 or below, you won't see it in the app.

The low target SDK block was also only added to base Android in Android 14. If installing older apps fails on older Android versions, you likely are running into a different issue.

### Why doesn't using "Grant All Requested Permissions" actually grant all permissions?
This option will only automatically grant _runtime_ permissions, like Camera or Microphone access.

Special permissions, like All Files Access, or special access, like Accessibility Services, will not be automatically granted or enabled.

### Why does setting the installer package name not work?
In Android 14, Google restricted what the shell user (ADB) is allowed to do in terms of specifying who installed an app. ADB is allowed to set the installer package field, but not the originating package field anymore.

There isn't a workaround for this, unfortunately. If your workflow depended on the originating package being set to a custom value, it won't work on Android 14 or later.

### Why can't I install apps in a Work Profile?
See the ["Shell does not have permission to access user X"](#shell-does-not-have-permission-to-access-user-x) section above.
